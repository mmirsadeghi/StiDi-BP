# StiDi-BP
Spike time displacement based error backpropagation in multilayer spiking neural networks

Here, we implement STiDi-BP, a novel supervised learning algorithm to directly train single spike-based temporal SNNs.
It is presented in "M. Mirsadeghi, M. Shalchian, S.R. Kheradpisheh and T. Masquelier, STiDi-BP: Spike time displacement based error backpropagation in
multilayer spiking neural networks, Neurocomputing (2021), doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.11.052", availbale at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231220318452.

we extend the STiDi-BP learning approach to be applicable in deeper and convolutional architectures in "M. Mirsadeghi, M. Shalchian, S.R. Kheradpisheh and T. Masquelier, Spike time displacement based error backpropagation in convolutional spiking neural networks". It is available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13621
"Forward_conv", "Forward_maxPooling", "Unpooled", "Backward_conv" and "Pre_ST_Conv" functions are provided to implement binary convolutional SNNs.

We will post the codes of the second paper here soon.
